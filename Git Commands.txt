git push --all -u (Pushing all branched to remote)

git push -u origin feature_branch_name (Pushing normal branch to remote)

git push origin --delete <branchName> (Deleting remote branch)

git branch -d <branch_name> (Deleting local branch)

git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] (Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch)

git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] (Push the branch on github )

git branch -m <newname> (Renaming a branch)





	* git init - Initialize a git repo
	* git add . - Add all change in The Directory
	* git commit -m "Message" - commit with a message
	* git log - List of all commits. (also can be sorted out by time)
	* git status - Changes to be committed. (The changes that were made)
	* git diff filename - show changes in the file (use git diff if all changes need to be shown)
	* git commit -am "msg" - add and commit. (Caveat - Does not work with renaming)
	* git reset HEAD filename - Unstage the file.(Suppose a file has been added by git add. So we want to change it. Now before commit i want         it not to be changed. I want it to stay uncommitted. Thus I'll need to remove what was added. So this will be used to do that)
	* git checkout (SHA optional) -- filename - If we need to revert the changes (If added the git reset needs to be used)
	* git commit --ament -m "msg" - Make EDITS to RECENT commit or the HEAD.
	* git revert SHA - Automatic revert to the specified version
	* git commit --ammend -m "" -- Change the LAST/RECENT commit.
	* git reset --hard SHA -- make the head pointer point to the sha we are wanting
	* git checkout branch -- checkout the branch and make everything look like that that branch
	* git checkout -- filename or directory name -- checkout the file in previous commit and make everything look like that
	* git push -u (remote branch) (branch name we want to put) -- push the branch to remote repository
	* git clone (repo location) (any name to directory) -- make a clone to the directory of the repository we specified
	* git clone -b (branch name we want to clone) (remote r) -- make a clone of THAT branch
	* git fetch [alias for example origin] -- tracks any changes made in remote branch. Without it the cloned project wont show any changes.
	* git remote show [alias] -- shows if anything was added in remote branch
	* git pull ----- git fetch + git merge


     cat .git/config -- see which branch tracking which


	* git branch branch_name --- creates a new branch
	* git checkout branch_name --- switches to the branch_name. Actually it makes the directory like branch_name
	* git diff branch1..branch2 --- difference between branch1 and branch2
	* git branch -d branch_name --- SAFELY DELETE the branch
	* git branch -D branch_name --- UNSAFELY DELETE the branch
	* git push [alias] [branch_name] --- push the branch in remote repository
	* git branch branchname [alias]/branchname_of_remote_branch --- create a branch named branchname to track remote branch specified (Remember to git fetch first)
	* git clean -f --- remove untracked files
	* git clean -f -d --- remove untracked directories


     

	* git merge branchname --- merges the branch specified with the branch currently checked in. merging will merge all the changes and then all will be committed.

	* git push origin --delete branch_name --- delete branch of remote repository


     git push -f --- force merge with the remote repo( very unsafe)

     Merging a remote branch---

	1. Merge the branch locally,
	2. then push the branch


     git push -u [alias] [branchname] --- pushes the branch to remote branch (example git push -u origin branch)

Problem : There are two branches. Fetch  a specific file from one branch then add that file to other branch.
Solution:
git checkout new_feature directory/file1

then it will checkout THAT specific file to the branch I'm currently on.
